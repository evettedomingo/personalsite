            <p>Hello! Evette Alexandria Domingo is my name, a 23 year- old Software Engineer in a multi-national company.
                I am also a Certified Android Application Developer and TESDA NCII Graphic Designer.</p>
                <p>I graduated with a degree in Bachelor of Science in Information Technology in a private institution named Colegio de San Juan
                    de Letran- Calamba. Before becoming a Software Engineer, I was once a Business Analyst in a shipping company.</p>
                   <p>There I gained a lot of knowledge regarding maritime, logistics, and shipping. I admit I have grown there professionally. But as years passed by, I realized that I may grow more, in my chosen field.</p> 
                   <p> Note that this is a demo site, I really don't know what I am doing right now :)</p>
                   <p>Want to know more? Appreciate if you could fill-out below :)</p>
